        <p>La Criée continues its involvement in the Rennes metropolitan area's transition process. The art center is implementing reuse initiatives, with the recovery and recycling of materials used during workshops and residencies, and the reuse of elements from exhibition scenography. Reflection on the eco-design of scenography and the move from 4 to 3 annual exhibitions are further evidence of this desire to move towards more sustainable productions. Travel for staff, contributors and works of art is also designed to reduce carbon emissions, for example by encouraging soft mobility or collaborations with local artists and businesses. In keeping with this idea of cooperation with local players, La Criée is committed to lending and exchanging exhibition materials with neighboring structures. <br></p>
