        <p>La Criée benefits from the City of Rennes' responsible digital policy, which includes extending the lifespan of equipment, using less energy-consuming computers, optimizing printing resources and re-using computer equipment.<br>The art center's staff are also involved in eco-actions and are made aware of the environmental challenges of digital technology via the Fresque du numérique. <br></p>

      notes: >-
        <p>**The manufacture of computer terminals accounts for 76 % of the resources used by the digital sector.<br>A 2kg computer requires the use of 200kg of fossil fuels, the extraction of 600kg of minerals (rare metals) and several thousand liters of fresh water.<br><br>Source: fresque du numérique</p>
