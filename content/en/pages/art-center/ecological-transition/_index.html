        <p>La Criée continues its involvement in the Rennes metropolitan area's transition process. The art center is implementing reuse initiatives, with the recovery and recycling of materials used during workshops and residencies, and the reuse of elements from exhibition scenography. Reflection on the eco-design of scenography and the move from 4 to 3 annual exhibitions are further evidence of this desire to move towards more sustainable productions. Travel for staff, contributors and works of art is also designed to reduce carbon emissions, for example by encouraging soft mobility or collaborations with local artists and businesses. In keeping with this idea of cooperation with local players, La Criée is committed to lending and exchanging exhibition materials with neighboring structures. <br></p>

        <p>(July 2023 - Spring 2024)<br>In 2022, DCA - the French association for the development of contemporary art centers*, of which La Criée is a member, received a grant from the French Ministry of Culture to assess the environmental impact of art centers in France. La Criée has been chosen to join a panel of five centers to be supported by Les Augures** and TranSyLience*** in carrying out an overall environmental diagnosis. The aim is to assess the obstacles and levers to the ecological transformation of art centers, and to implement actions adapted to each structure. La Criée will also benefit from a complete carbon footprint assessment in the first half of 2024.<br>Following this assessment and diagnostic phase, La Criée will put in place an action plan with concrete objectives, the results of which will be shared on a regular basis.<br></p>
